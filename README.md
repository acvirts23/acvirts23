- 👋 Hi, I’m Andrew Virts, a recent graduate from Millersville University with a BS in Computer Science.
- 📫 How to reach me ...
  - email: andrewcvirts@gmail.com

-Here is where you will find all of my projects, both those done in school as well as my personal projects

-All of the content in the projects/labs repo are projects completed during my time at school

-Every other repo contains projects that are my own personal creations!

-I am particularly interested in the cryptocurrency space and hope to develop on the solana blockchain one day

 - 🏂 Outside of software development I am an avid snowboarder who has traveled all over the country pursuing my passion. I look forward to checking off big-ticket resorts and mountains every winter and hope to make a trip outside of the country to ride in the Swiss Alps in the near future. 🏔️
